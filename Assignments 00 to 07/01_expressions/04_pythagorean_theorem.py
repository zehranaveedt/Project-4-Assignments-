# Write a program that asks the user for the lengths of the two perpendicular sides of a right triangle and outputs the length of the third side (the hypotenuse) using the Pythagorean theorem!
# The Pythagorean theorem, named after the ancient Greek thinker, Pythagoras, is a fundamental relation in geometry. It states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides.
# For instance, let's consider a right triangle ABC, with the right angle located at C. According to the Pythagorean theorem:
# BC ** 2 = AB ** 2 + AC ** 2Your code should read in the lengths of the sides AB and AC, and that outputs the length of the hypotenuse (BC). You will probably find math.sqrt() to be useful.
# Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics):
# Enter the length of AB: 3
# Enter the length of AC: 4
# The length of BC (the hypotenuse) is: 5.0

def main():
    ab: float = float(input("Enter the length of AB: "))
    ac: float = float(input("Enter the length of AC: "))

    bc: float = math.sqrt(ab**2 + ac**2)
    print("The length of BC (the hypotenuse) is: " + str(bc))
