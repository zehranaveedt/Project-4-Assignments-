# Write a program to solve this age-related riddle!
# Anton, Beth, Chen, Drew, and Ethan are all friends. Their ages are as follows:
# Anton is 21 years old.
# Beth is 6 years older than Anton.
# Chen is 20 years older than Beth.
# Drew is as old as Chen's age plus Anton's age.
# Ethan is the same age as Chen.

# solution

def main():
    anton : int = 21            # Anton's age is given as 21 years old
    beth : int = 6 + anton      # Beth is 6 years older than Anton, so add 6 to Anton's age to get Beth's
    chen : int = 20 + beth      # Chen is 20 years older than Beth, so add 20 to Beth's age to get Chen's
    drew  : int= chen + anton   # Drew is as old as Chen's age plus Anton's age, so add them together
    ethan : int = chen          # Ethan is the same age as Chen, so set Ethan's age equal to Chen's

   # Print out all of the ages!
